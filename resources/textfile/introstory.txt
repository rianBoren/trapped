Ah, what a headache...

You end up opening your eyes, just to find yourself in a smelly and dark room. 
You start looking around for a little bit, and you just see that you woke up from a bed
There's no idea or clue about what happened last night and how you got there
All you know is that you went to a friend's birthday party
Then you drank lots of Margaritas, and you have no idea what happened afterwards.
Are you trapped inside this place? How can you get out? 

A phone is ringing......



You pick up the phone, there is a creepy and scary sounds:
WE WILL TRAP ALL THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. THE DOOR IS LOCKED. IF YOU ARE SMART ENOUGH, TRY TO
LOOK FOR CLUES AND HELP YOURSELF. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN ESCAPE! ENJOY YOUR STAY HERE! HA HA HA...

You still cannot believe this, hang up the phone, and go to the door.
It IS LOCKED! The door lock required 3 digit password.
You tried random numbers, but neither works.

Fine....

You decided to try....
