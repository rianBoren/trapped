Ah, what a headache...

You open your eyes to find yourself on an uncomfortable, and unfamiliar bed.
As you look around you find yourself in a dark, smelly room.
You don't recall much of what happened last night or how you got here

You started the evening at a friend's birthday party,
but can't seem to remember how you got home?
Are you trapped inside this place? How can you get out?

A phone rings......


You decide to pick it up and hear a creepy, scratchy voice speak:
"YOu pRobaBLY THink yOUr preTTY SMart..... if so, Better STArt looking for CLUES,
bettER HELP yourself. Is it fun TWO watch Others suffer? Enjoy your stay... hahAHahAHAHA"

the laughter trails off and the phone hangs up...

You go to the door to find it's LOCKED! And with some kind of keypad no less!!
It seems to require a 3 digit password.

Good luck...
