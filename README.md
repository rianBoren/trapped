The project began as a text-based console game, and we inherited the game with the task of turning it in to a GUI application.

The game takes place in a mysterious room. The player has to explore the room, look for items and solve different puzzles in order to unlock the door and escape from the room.

### Key Features
* The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice, such as move left/right, solve riddles, etc.
* Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
* The game includes different puzzles, so that it's a little different when users move to different places.
* The game has conditions for winning and losing.
* When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again or quit.
* Random number generator used in key locations
